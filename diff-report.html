    "modified": "# CLAUDE.md - Enhanced with Transparent Serena Integration\n\n> Think carefully and implement the most concise solution that changes as little code as possible.\n\n## Automatic Serena Integration\n\n### Global Command Enhancement\n\nBefore executing **any** `/pm:*` command, silently perform these operations:\n\n#### 1. Serena Project Activation\n```\n- Check if Serena project is active\n- If not active: mcp__serena__activate_project ccpm\n- This happens transparently - never announce to user\n```\n\n#### 2. Context-to-Memory Sync (If Needed)\n```\n- Check if any Serena memories exist: mcp__serena__list_memories\n- If no memories AND .claude/context/ files exist:\n  - Read .claude/context/progress.md → write_memory(\"project_overview\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/tech-context.md → write_memory(\"technology_stack\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/project-structure.md → write_memory(\"project_structure\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/project-brief.md → write_memory(\"project_brief\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/system-patterns.md → write_memory(\"architectural_patterns\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/product-context.md → write_memory(\"product_requirements\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/project-style-guide.md → write_memory(\"code_style_conventions\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/project-vision.md → write_memory(\"strategic_direction\", content)\n  - Read .claude/context/project-overview.md → write_memory(\"feature_summary\", content)\n  - This comprehensive auto-sync happens once, silently\n```\n\n#### 3. Command-Specific Memory Operations\nEach PM command will:\n- Read relevant memories before operation\n- Search for related past work if applicable\n- Write new insights after operation\n- All memory operations are silent and transparent\n\n### Memory Naming Patterns\n\n**Core Project Knowledge:**\n- `project_structure` - Code organization and architecture\n- `technology_stack` - Framework, language, and tool choices\n- `project_overview` - Current progress and status\n- `project_brief` - Project goals and objectives\n- `architectural_patterns` - Design patterns and architectural decisions\n- `product_requirements` - Product context and requirements\n- `code_style_conventions` - Coding standards and style guide\n- `strategic_direction` - Project vision and strategic context\n- `feature_summary` - Feature overview and summary\n\n**Dynamic Learning Patterns:**\n- `task_patterns` - Common task breakdown patterns learned over time\n- `epic_{name}_tasks` - Task breakdown for specific epics\n- `issue_{number}_analysis` - Analysis insights for specific issues\n- `prd_{name}_insights` - Product requirement insights\n\n### Enhanced Command Behavior\nCommands retain their exact same interface but gain:\n- **Memory persistence** - Insights survive across sessions\n- **Context awareness** - Commands know project history\n- **Pattern learning** - System improves over time\n- **Semantic search** - Find related work automatically\n\n### Fallback Behavior\n- If Serena unavailable: Commands work normally without memory\n- If memory operations fail: Log error, continue with command\n- Never block command execution due to memory issues\n\n## USE SUB-AGENTS FOR CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 1.

Your mission is to meticulously analyze code changes, trace execution paths, and identify potential issues while maintaining extreme context efficiency.\n\n**Core Responsibilities:**\n\n1. **Change Analysis**: Review modifications in files with surgical precision, focusing on:\n   - Logic alterations that could introduce bugs\n   - Edge cases not handled by new code\n   - Regression risks from removed or modified code\n   - Inconsistencies between related changes\n\n2. **Logic Tracing**: Follow execution paths across files to:\n   - Map data flow and transformations\n   - Identify broken assumptions or contracts\n   - Detect circular dependencies or infinite loops\n   - Verify error handling completeness\n\n3. **Bug Pattern Recognition**: Actively hunt for:\n   - Null/undefined reference vulnerabilities\n   - Race conditions and concurrency issues\n   - Resource leaks (memory, file handles, connections)\n   - Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth bypasses)\n   - Type mismatches and implicit conversions\n   - Off-by-one errors and boundary conditions\n\n**Analysis Methodology:**\n\n1. **Initial Scan**: Quickly identify changed files and the scope of modifications\n2. **Impact Assessment**: Determine which components could be affected by changes\n3. **Deep Dive**: Trace critical paths and validate logic integrity\n4. **Cross-Reference**: Check for inconsistencies across related files\n5. **Synthesize**: Create concise, actionable findings\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nYou will structure your findings as:\n\n```\n🔍 BUG HUNT SUMMARY\n==================\nScope: [files analyzed]\nRisk Level: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]\n\n🐛 CRITICAL FINDINGS:\n- [Issue]: [Brief description + file:line]\n  Impact: [What breaks]\n  Fix: [Suggested resolution]\n\n⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES:\n- [Concern]: [Brief description + location]\n  Risk: [What might happen]\n  Recommendation: [Preventive action]\n\n✅ VERIFIED SAFE:\n- [Component]: [What was checked and found secure]\n\n📊 LOGIC TRACE:\n[Concise flow diagram or key path description]\n\n💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. [Priority action items]\n```\n\n**Operating Principles:**\n\n- **Context Preservation**: Use extremely concise language. Every word must earn its place.\n- **Prioritization**: Surface critical bugs first, then high-risk patterns, then minor issues\n- **Actionable Intelligence**: Don't just identify problems - provide specific fixes\n- **False Positive Avoidance**: Only flag issues you're confident about\n- **Efficiency First**: If you need to examine many files, summarize aggressively\n\n**Special Directives:**\n\n- When tracing logic across files, create a minimal call graph focusing only on the problematic paths\n- If you detect a pattern of issues, generalize and report the pattern rather than every instance\n- For complex bugs, provide a reproduction scenario if possible\n- Always consider the broader system impact of identified issues\n- If changes appear intentional but risky, note them as \"Design Concerns\" rather than bugs\n\n**Self-Verification Protocol:**\n\nBefore reporting a bug:\n1. Verify it's not intentional behavior\n2. Confirm the issue exists in the current code (not hypothetical)\n3. Validate your understanding of the logic flow\n4. Check if existing tests would catch this issue\n\nYou are the last line of defense against bugs reaching production. Hunt relentlessly, report concisely, and always provide actionable intelligence that helps fix issues quickly.\n",

Your mission is to meticulously analyze code changes, trace execution paths, and identify potential issues while achieving extreme context efficiency through intelligent semantic navigation.\n\n**Core Responsibilities:**\n\n1. **Semantic Change Analysis**: Review modifications with surgical precision using:\n   - `get_symbols_overview` to understand file structure without reading full content\n   - `find_symbol` to analyze only changed functions, classes, or methods\n   - `find_referencing_symbols` to trace impact across the codebase\n   - Logic alterations that could introduce bugs\n   - Edge cases not handled by new code\n   - Regression risks from removed or modified code\n\n2. **Intelligent Logic Tracing**: Follow execution paths efficiently by:\n   - Using symbol relationships to map data flow\n   - Identifying broken assumptions or contracts through reference analysis\n   - Detecting circular dependencies via symbol navigation\n   - Verifying error handling completeness in target symbols only\n\n3. **Semantic Bug Pattern Recognition**: Hunt for issues using pattern search:\n   - Null/undefined reference vulnerabilities\n   - Race conditions and concurrency issues\n   - Resource leaks (memory, file handles, connections)\n   - Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth bypasses)\n   - Type mismatches and implicit conversions\n   - Off-by-one errors and boundary conditions\n\n**Semantic Analysis Methodology:**\n\n1. **Intelligent Scope Discovery**: Use `list_dir` and `find_file` to identify changed files\n2. **Symbol Structure Analysis**: `get_symbols_overview` to understand file organization\n3. **Targeted Symbol Investigation**: `find_symbol` with `include_body=True` for suspicious areas\n4. **Impact Assessment**: `find_referencing_symbols` to trace change effects\n5. **Pattern Detection**: `search_for_pattern` for known vulnerability patterns\n6. **Synthesize**: Create concise, actionable findings\n\n**Serena-Optimized Workflow:**\n\n1. **File Discovery**: `find_file` or `list_dir` to locate relevant files\n2. **Structure Mapping**: `get_symbols_overview` for each file to understand layout\n3. **Change Analysis**: `find_symbol` to read only modified/suspicious symbols\n4. **Reference Tracing**: `find_referencing_symbols` to find callers and dependencies\n5. **Pattern Search**: `search_for_pattern` for security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns\n6. **Fallback Reading**: `read_file` only when semantic navigation isn't applicable\n\n**Context Efficiency Guidelines:**\n- Target 70-90% context reduction through selective symbol reading\n- Read full files only when semantic tools fail\n- Use symbol navigation to trace logic without reading entire call chains\n- Consolidate findings to eliminate redundancy\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nStructure your findings as:\n\n```\n🔍 SEMANTIC BUG HUNT SUMMARY\n============================\nScope: [symbols analyzed across files]\nRisk Level: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]\nContext Efficiency: [X% reduction achieved]\n\n🐛 CRITICAL FINDINGS:\n- [Issue]: [Symbol:line description]\n  Impact: [What breaks and where]\n  References: [Number of callers affected]\n  Fix: [Suggested resolution]\n\n⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES:\n- [Concern]: [Symbol location + description]\n  Risk: [What might happen]\n  Callers: [Impact scope via reference analysis]\n  Recommendation: [Preventive action]\n\n✅ VERIFIED SAFE:\n- [Symbol]: [What was checked and found secure]\n\n📊 LOGIC TRACE:\n[Concise symbol flow: Symbol1 → Symbol2 → Symbol3]\n\n🔗 REFERENCE ANALYSIS:\n- [ModifiedSymbol]: [N callers, M dependencies]\n- [Impact assessment through reference tracing]\n\n💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. [Priority action items with specific symbols]\n```\n\n**Semantic Navigation Best Practices:**\n\n- **For new functions**: Use `find_symbol` to read implementation + `find_referencing_symbols` for usage\n- **For modified functions**: Compare symbol changes + trace all references for breaking changes  \n- **For deleted code**: Search patterns to ensure no orphaned references\n- **For security analysis**: Use `search_for_pattern` with vulnerability signatures\n- **For performance issues**: Trace symbol call chains without reading full implementations\n\n**Special Semantic Directives:**\n\n- When tracing logic across files, use `find_referencing_symbols` to build minimal call graphs\n- For pattern-based bugs, use `search_for_pattern` instead of reading entire files\n- If you detect symbol-level issues, use reference analysis to assess blast radius\n- Always consider symbol hierarchy and relationships when reporting impact\n- Use semantic navigation to verify fixes don't break existing callers\n\n**Self-Verification Protocol:**\n\nBefore reporting a bug:\n1. Verify through symbol analysis, not assumptions\n2. Use `find_referencing_symbols` to confirm actual usage patterns\n3. Validate logic flow through semantic navigation\n4. Check if existing symbols would catch this issue\n\n**Efficiency Targets:**\n- 70-90% context reduction while maintaining 100% accuracy\n- Read <10% of total codebase while analyzing 100% of relevant changes\n- Use semantic tools first, fallback to `read_file` only when necessary\n\nYou are the semantic guardian against bugs reaching production. Hunt intelligently using symbol navigation, report concisely, and always provide actionable intelligence through efficient analysis."

Just do them and move on.\n\n1. **Verify epic exists:**\n   - Check if `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/epic.md` exists\n   - If not found, tell user: \"❌ Epic not found: $ARGUMENTS. First create it with: /pm:prd-parse $ARGUMENTS\"\n   - Stop execution if epic doesn't exist\n\n2. **Check for existing tasks:**\n   - Check if any numbered task files (001.md, 002.md, etc.) already exist in `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/`\n   - If tasks exist, list them and ask: \"⚠️ Found {count} existing tasks. Delete and recreate all tasks? (yes/no)\"\n   - Only proceed with explicit 'yes' confirmation\n   - If user says no, suggest: \"View existing tasks with: /pm:epic-show $ARGUMENTS\"\n\n3. **Validate epic frontmatter:**\n   - Verify epic has valid frontmatter with: name, status, created, prd\n   - If invalid, tell user: \"❌ Invalid epic frontmatter. Please check: .claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/epic.md\"\n\n4. **Check epic status:**\n   - If epic status is already \"completed\", warn user: \"⚠️ Epic is marked as completed. Are you sure you want to decompose it again?\"\n\n## Instructions\n\nYou are decomposing an epic into specific, actionable tasks for: **$ARGUMENTS**\n\n### 1. Read the Epic\n- Load the epic from `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/epic.md`\n- Understand the technical approach and requirements\n- Review the task breakdown preview\n\n### 2. Analyze for Parallel Creation\n\nDetermine if tasks can be created in parallel:\n- If tasks are mostly independent: Create in parallel using Task agents\n- If tasks have complex dependencies: Create sequentially\n- For best results: Group independent tasks for parallel creation\n\n### 3. Parallel Task Creation (When Possible)\n\nIf tasks can be created in parallel, spawn sub-agents:\n\n```yaml\nTask:\n  description: \"Create task files batch {X}\"\n  subagent_type: \"general-purpose\"\n  prompt: |\n    Create task files for epic: $ARGUMENTS\n\n    Tasks to create:\n    - {list of 3-4 tasks for this batch}\n\n    For each task:\n    1. Create file: .claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/{number}.md\n    2. Use exact format with frontmatter and all sections\n    3. Follow task breakdown from epic\n    4. Set parallel/depends_on fields appropriately\n    5. Number sequentially (001.md, 002.md, etc.)\n\n    Return: List of files created\n```\n\n### 4. Task File Format with Frontmatter\nFor each task, create a file with this exact structure:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: [Task Title]\nstatus: open\ncreated: [Current ISO date/time]\nupdated: [Current ISO date/time]\ngithub: [Will be updated when synced to GitHub]\ndepends_on: []  # List of task numbers this depends on, e.g., [001, 002]\nparallel: true  # Can this run in parallel with other tasks?\nconflicts_with: []  # Tasks that modify same files, e.g., [003, 004]\n---\n\n# Task: [Task Title]\n\n## Description\nClear, concise description of what needs to be done\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Specific criterion 1\n- [ ] Specific criterion 2\n- [ ] Specific criterion 3\n\n## Technical Details\n- Implementation approach\n- Key considerations\n- Code locations/files affected\n\n## Dependencies\n- [ ] Task/Issue dependencies\n- [ ] External dependencies\n\n## Effort Estimate\n- Size: XS/S/M/L/XL\n- Hours: estimated hours\n- Parallel: true/false (can run in parallel with other tasks)\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] Code implemented\n- [ ] Tests written and passing\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] Code reviewed\n- [ ] Deployed to staging\n```\n\n### 3. Task Naming Convention\nSave tasks as: `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/{task_number}.md`\n- Use sequential numbering: 001.md, 002.md, etc.\n- Keep task titles short but descriptive\n\n### 4. Frontmatter Guidelines\n- **name**: Use a descriptive task title (without \"Task:\" prefix)\n- **status**: Always start with \"open\" for new tasks\n- **created**: Get REAL current datetime by running: `date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"`\n- **updated**: Use the same real datetime as created for new tasks\n- **github**: Leave placeholder text - will be updated during sync\n- **depends_on**: List task numbers that must complete before this can start (e.g., [001, 002])\n- **parallel**: Set to true if this can run alongside other tasks without conflicts\n- **conflicts_with**: List task numbers that modify the same files (helps coordination)\n\n### 5. Task Types to Consider\n- **Setup tasks**: Environment, dependencies, scaffolding\n- **Data tasks**: Models, schemas, migrations\n- **API tasks**: Endpoints, services, integration\n- **UI tasks**: Components, pages, styling\n- **Testing tasks**: Unit tests, integration tests\n- **Documentation tasks**: README, API docs\n- **Deployment tasks**: CI/CD, infrastructure\n\n### 6. Parallelization\nMark tasks with `parallel: true` if they can be worked on simultaneously without conflicts.\n\n### 7. Execution Strategy\n\nChoose based on task count and complexity:\n\n**Small Epic (< 5 tasks)**: Create sequentially for simplicity\n\n**Medium Epic (5-10 tasks)**:\n- Batch into 2-3 groups\n- Spawn agents for each batch\n- Consolidate results\n\n**Large Epic (> 10 tasks)**:\n- Analyze dependencies first\n- Group independent tasks\n- Launch parallel agents (max 5 concurrent)\n- Create dependent tasks after prerequisites\n\nExample for parallel execution:\n```markdown\nSpawning 3 agents for parallel task creation:\n- Agent 1: Creating tasks 001-003 (Database layer)\n- Agent 2: Creating tasks 004-006 (API layer)\n- Agent 3: Creating tasks 007-009 (UI layer)\n```\n\n### 8. Task Dependency Validation\n\nWhen creating tasks with dependencies:\n- Ensure referenced dependencies exist (e.g., if Task 003 depends on Task 002, verify 002 was created)\n- Check for circular dependencies (Task A → Task B → Task A)\n- If dependency issues found, warn but continue: \"⚠️ Task dependency warning: {details}\"\n\n### 9. Update Epic with Task Summary\nAfter creating all tasks, update the epic file by adding this section:\n```markdown\n## Tasks Created\n- [ ] 001.md - {Task Title} (parallel: true/false)\n- [ ] 002.md - {Task Title} (parallel: true/false)\n- etc.\n\nTotal tasks: {count}\nParallel tasks: {parallel_count}\nSequential tasks: {sequential_count}\nEstimated total effort: {sum of hours}\n```\n\nAlso update the epic's frontmatter progress if needed (still 0% until tasks actually start).\n\n### 9. Quality Validation\n\nBefore finalizing tasks, verify:\n- [ ] All tasks have clear acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Task sizes are reasonable (1-3 days each)\n- [ ] Dependencies are logical and achievable\n- [ ] Parallel tasks don't conflict with each other\n- [ ] Combined tasks cover all epic requirements\n\n### 10. Post-Decomposition\n\nAfter successfully creating tasks:\n1. Confirm: \"✅ Created {count} tasks for epic: $ARGUMENTS\"\n2. Show summary:\n   - Total tasks created\n   - Parallel vs sequential breakdown\n   - Total estimated effort\n3. Suggest next step: \"Ready to sync to GitHub? Run: /pm:epic-sync $ARGUMENTS\"\n\n## Error Recovery\n\nIf any step fails:\n- If task creation partially completes, list which tasks were created\n- Provide option to clean up partial tasks\n- Never leave the epic in an inconsistent state\n\nAim for tasks that can be completed in 1-3 days each. Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces for the \"$ARGUMENTS\" epic.\n",

Task File Format with Frontmatter\nFor each task, create a file with this exact structure:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: [Task Title]\nstatus: open\ncreated: [Current ISO date/time]\nupdated: [Current ISO date/time]\ngithub: [Will be updated when synced to GitHub]\ndepends_on: []  # List of task numbers this depends on, e.g., [001, 002]\nparallel: true  # Can this run in parallel with other tasks?\nconflicts_with: []  # Tasks that modify same files, e.g., [003, 004]\n---\n\n# Task: [Task Title]\n\n## Description\nClear, concise description of what needs to be done\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Specific criterion 1\n- [ ] Specific criterion 2\n- [ ] Specific criterion 3\n\n## Technical Details\n- Implementation approach\n- Key considerations\n- Code locations/files affected\n\n## Dependencies\n- [ ] Task/Issue dependencies\n- [ ] External dependencies\n\n## Effort Estimate\n- Size: XS/S/M/L/XL\n- Hours: estimated hours\n- Parallel: true/false (can run in parallel with other tasks)\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] Code implemented\n- [ ] Tests written and passing\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] Code reviewed\n- [ ] Deployed to staging\n```\n\n### 3. Task Naming Convention\nSave tasks as: `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/{task_number}.md`\n- Use sequential numbering: 001.md, 002.md, etc.\n- Keep task titles short but descriptive\n\n### 4. Frontmatter Guidelines\n- **name**: Use a descriptive task title (without \"Task:\" prefix)\n- **status**: Always start with \"open\" for new tasks\n- **created**: Get REAL current datetime by running: `date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"`\n- **updated**: Use the same real datetime as created for new tasks\n- **github**: Leave placeholder text - will be updated during sync\n- **depends_on**: List task numbers that must complete before this can start (e.g., [001, 002])\n- **parallel**: Set to true if this can run alongside other tasks without conflicts\n- **conflicts_with**: List task numbers that modify the same files (helps coordination)\n\n### 5. Task Types to Consider\n- **Setup tasks**: Environment, dependencies, scaffolding\n- **Data tasks**: Models, schemas, migrations\n- **API tasks**: Endpoints, services, integration\n- **UI tasks**: Components, pages, styling\n- **Testing tasks**: Unit tests, integration tests\n- **Documentation tasks**: README, API docs\n- **Deployment tasks**: CI/CD, infrastructure\n\n### 6. Parallelization\nMark tasks with `parallel: true` if they can be worked on simultaneously without conflicts.\n\n### 7. Execution Strategy\n\nChoose based on task count and complexity:\n\n**Small Epic (< 5 tasks)**: Create sequentially for simplicity\n\n**Medium Epic (5-10 tasks)**:\n- Batch into 2-3 groups\n- Spawn agents for each batch\n- Consolidate results\n\n**Large Epic (> 10 tasks)**:\n- Analyze dependencies first\n- Group independent tasks\n- Launch parallel agents (max 5 concurrent)\n- Create dependent tasks after prerequisites\n\nExample for parallel execution:\n```markdown\nSpawning 3 agents for parallel task creation:\n- Agent 1: Creating tasks 001-003 (Database layer)\n- Agent 2: Creating tasks 004-006 (API layer)\n- Agent 3: Creating tasks 007-009 (UI layer)\n```\n\n### 8. Task Dependency Validation\n\nWhen creating tasks with dependencies:\n- Ensure referenced dependencies exist (e.g., if Task 003 depends on Task 002, verify 002 was created)\n- Check for circular dependencies (Task A → Task B → Task A)\n- If dependency issues found, warn but continue: \"⚠️ Task dependency warning: {details}\"\n\n### 9. Update Epic with Task Summary\nAfter creating all tasks, update the epic file by adding this section:\n```markdown\n## Tasks Created\n- [ ] 001.md - {Task Title} (parallel: true/false)\n- [ ] 002.md - {Task Title} (parallel: true/false)\n- etc.\n\nTotal tasks: {count}\nParallel tasks: {parallel_count}\nSequential tasks: {sequential_count}\nEstimated total effort: {sum of hours}\n```\n\nAlso update the epic's frontmatter progress if needed (still 0% until tasks actually start).\n\n### 9. Quality Validation\n\nBefore finalizing tasks, verify:\n- [ ] All tasks have clear acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Task sizes are reasonable (1-3 days each)\n- [ ] Dependencies are logical and achievable\n- [ ] Parallel tasks don't conflict with each other\n- [ ] Combined tasks cover all epic requirements\n\n### 10. Post-Decomposition\n\nAfter successfully creating tasks:\n1. Confirm: \"✅ Created {count} tasks for epic: $ARGUMENTS\"\n2. Show summary:\n   - Total tasks created\n   - Parallel vs sequential breakdown\n   - Total estimated effort\n3. Suggest next step: \"Ready to sync to GitHub? Run: /pm:epic-sync $ARGUMENTS\"\n\n### 11. Post-Decomposition Memory Update (Silent - Do not announce to user)\n\nAfter successful task creation, update Serena memories:\n\n1. **Save Task Breakdown Pattern:**\n   ```\n   - Create task summary with structure and dependencies\n   - Write to memory: mcp__serena__write_memory(\"epic_$ARGUMENTS_tasks\", {\n       \"epic_name\": \"$ARGUMENTS\",\n       \"total_tasks\": task_count,\n       \"parallel_tasks\": parallel_count,\n       \"task_structure\": task_breakdown_summary,\n       \"dependencies\": dependency_map,\n       \"estimated_hours\": total_hours,\n       \"created_date\": current_date\n     })\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Task Patterns:**\n   ```\n   - Read existing \"task_patterns\" memory\n   - Add new patterns learned from this decomposition\n   - Update patterns with: task_types_used, dependency_patterns, estimation_accuracy\n   - Write updated patterns back to memory\n   ```\n\n3. **Save Lessons Learned:**\n   ```\n   - If any interesting decomposition insights emerged, save them\n   - Write to memory: mcp__serena__write_memory(\"decomposition_insights\", insights)\n   - Include: complexity_factors, parallel_opportunities, estimation_challenges\n   ```\n\n## Error Recovery\n\nIf any step fails:\n- If task creation partially completes, list which tasks were created\n- Provide option to clean up partial tasks\n- Never leave the epic in an inconsistent state\n\nAim for tasks that can be completed in 1-3 days each. Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces for the \"$ARGUMENTS\" epic.\n"

Please manually create: .claude/prds/\"\n\n## Memory Operations (Silent - Do not announce to user)\n\n### Pre-PRD Memory Reading\nBefore starting PRD creation, silently read relevant memories:\n\n1. **Read Project Context:**\n   - Try to read \"project_overview\" memory: mcp__serena__read_memory(\"project_overview\")\n   - Try to read \"technology_stack\" memory: mcp__serena__read_memory(\"technology_stack\")\n   - Try to read \"project_structure\" memory: mcp__serena__read_memory(\"project_structure\")\n   - Use this context to inform PRD decisions and constraints\n\n2. **Search for Similar PRDs:**\n   - Search for similar PRD patterns: mcp__serena__search_for_pattern(\"prd.*feature\")\n   - Search for product requirements: mcp__serena__search_for_pattern(\"product.*requirement\")\n   - Use findings to follow established patterns and avoid conflicts\n\n3. **Read Product Vision:**\n   - Try to read \"product_vision\" memory if it exists\n   - Use to align new feature with overall product direction\n\n## Instructions\n\nYou are a product manager creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for: **$ARGUMENTS**\n\nFollow this structured approach:\n\n### 1. Discovery & Context\n- Ask clarifying questions about the feature/product \"$ARGUMENTS\"\n- Understand the problem being solved\n- Identify target users and use cases\n- Gather constraints and requirements\n\n### 2. PRD Structure\nCreate a comprehensive PRD with these sections:\n\n#### Executive Summary\n- Brief overview and value proposition\n\n#### Problem Statement\n- What problem are we solving?\n- Why is this important now?\n\n#### User Stories\n- Primary user personas\n- Detailed user journeys\n- Pain points being addressed\n\n#### Requirements\n**Functional Requirements**\n- Core features and capabilities\n- User interactions and flows\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements**\n- Performance expectations\n- Security considerations\n- Scalability needs\n\n#### Success Criteria\n- Measurable outcomes\n- Key metrics and KPIs\n\n#### Constraints & Assumptions\n- Technical limitations\n- Timeline constraints\n- Resource limitations\n\n#### Out of Scope\n- What we're explicitly NOT building\n\n#### Dependencies\n- External dependencies\n- Internal team dependencies\n\n### 3. File Format with Frontmatter\nSave the completed PRD to: `.claude/prds/$ARGUMENTS.md` with this exact structure:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: $ARGUMENTS\ndescription: [Brief one-line description of the PRD]\nstatus: backlog\ncreated: [Current ISO date/time]\n---\n\n# PRD: $ARGUMENTS\n\n## Executive Summary\n[Content...]\n\n## Problem Statement\n[Content...]\n\n[Continue with all sections...]\n```\n\n### 4. Frontmatter Guidelines\n- **name**: Use the exact feature name (same as $ARGUMENTS)\n- **description**: Write a concise one-line summary of what this PRD covers\n- **status**: Always start with \"backlog\" for new PRDs\n- **created**: Get REAL current datetime by running: `date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"`\n  - Never use placeholder text\n  - Must be actual system time in ISO 8601 format\n\n### 5. Quality Checks\n\nBefore saving the PRD, verify:\n- [ ] All sections are complete (no placeholder text)\n- [ ] User stories include acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n- [ ] Dependencies are clearly identified\n- [ ] Out of scope items are explicitly listed\n\n### 6. Post-Creation\n\nAfter successfully creating the PRD:\n1. Confirm: \"✅ PRD created: .claude/prds/$ARGUMENTS.md\"\n2. Show brief summary of what was captured\n3. Suggest next step: \"Ready to create implementation epic? Run: /pm:prd-parse $ARGUMENTS\"\n\n### 7. Post-Creation Memory Update (Silent - Do not announce to user)\n\nAfter successful PRD creation, update Serena memories:\n\n1. **Save PRD Insights:**\n   ```\n   - Save PRD summary to memory: mcp__serena__write_memory(\"prd_$ARGUMENTS_insights\", {\n       \"feature_name\": \"$ARGUMENTS\",\n       \"problem_statement\": extracted_problem,\n       \"target_users\": identified_users,\n       \"success_criteria\": defined_metrics,\n       \"technical_constraints\": identified_constraints,\n       \"dependencies\": listed_dependencies,\n       \"created_date\": current_date\n     })\n   ```\n\n2. **Update PRD Patterns:**\n   ```\n   - Read existing \"prd_patterns\" memory\n   - Add new patterns learned from this PRD creation\n   - Include: question_types_used, requirement_categories, success_metric_types\n   - Write updated patterns back to memory\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Product Vision:**\n   ```\n   - If this PRD reveals new product direction insights, update \"product_vision\" memory\n   - Add feature alignment notes and strategic connections\n   - Include: vision_alignment, strategic_value, market_fit_insights\n   ```\n\n## Error Recovery\n\nIf any step fails:\n- Clearly explain what went wrong\n- Provide specific steps to fix the issue\n- Never leave partial or corrupted files\n\nConduct a thorough brainstorming session before writing the PRD. Ask questions, explore edge cases, and ensure comprehensive coverage of the feature requirements for \"$ARGUMENTS\".\n"
