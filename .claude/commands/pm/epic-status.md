# Epic Status

Show real-time status of epic execution with parallel agents.

## Usage
```
/pm:epic-status <epic_name>
```

## Quick Check

```bash
test -f .claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/epic.md || echo "‚ùå Epic not found: $ARGUMENTS"
```

## Instructions

### 1. Check Worktree Status

```bash
# Check if worktree exists
git worktree list | grep "epic-$ARGUMENTS"
```

If worktree exists:
```bash
# Get current status
cd ../epic-$ARGUMENTS
git status --short
git log --oneline -5
cd -
```

### 2. Read Execution Status

Read `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/execution-status.md` if it exists.
Extract:
- Active agents and their streams
- Start times
- Queued issues
- Completed work

### 3. Check Stream Progress

For each active issue, read progress files:
```
.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/updates/{issue}/stream-*.md
```

Compile:
- Stream status (in_progress, completed, blocked)
- Completion percentage
- Current activity
- Any blockers

### 4. Analyze Git Activity

In the worktree:
```bash
# Recent commits by agents
cd ../epic-$ARGUMENTS
git log --oneline --since="1 day ago" | head -20

# Files being modified
git status --porcelain

# Uncommitted changes per area
git diff --stat

cd -
```

### 5. Check Issue Status

For each issue involved:
```bash
# Get GitHub status
gh issue view {issue_number} --json state,labels,assignees
```

Compare with local status to detect sync needs.

### 6. Identify Problems

Look for:
- Agents that haven't committed recently (>30 min)
- Streams marked as blocked
- Merge conflicts in worktree
- Failed tests or builds
- Divergence from main branch

### 7. Display Comprehensive Status

```

### 8. Provide Actionable Information

Based on status, suggest:
- If agents blocked: How to unblock
- If no recent commits: Check if agents need help
- If conflicts detected: How to resolve
- If work complete: Next steps for merging

## Quick Status Format

- "‚ùå Worktree missing. Run: /pm:epic-start $ARGUMENTS"
- "‚ö†Ô∏è Execution stalled - no activity for 1 hour"

## Important Notes

- Should complete quickly (<5 seconds)
- Focus on actionable information
- Highlight problems that need attention
