# Blocked

Show all blocked tasks and their blockers.

## Usage
```
/pm:blocked
```

## Instructions

### 1. Scan for Blocked Tasks

Search across all epic directories:
- Look in progress.md files for "blocked", "waiting", "dependency"
- Check task files for dependency fields that reference open tasks
- Find tasks with 0% progress despite being started >2 days ago

### 2. Identify Blocker Types

Categorize blockers:
- **Dependency**: Waiting on another task
- **External**: Waiting on external team/service
- **Information**: Missing requirements/specs
- **Technical**: Technical issue blocking progress
- **Review**: Waiting for review/approval

### 3. Display Blocked Tasks

```
