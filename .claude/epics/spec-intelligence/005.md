# Task: PM Integration Bridge

## Description
Create integration hooks that connect the spec intelligence compiler into existing PM commands (prd-new, epic-create, etc.). This bridge enables automatic specification enhancement during the normal PM workflow, making spec intelligence transparent to users while improving output quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration hooks for prd-new command with automatic enhancement
- [ ] Integration hooks for epic-create command with spec validation
- [ ] Seamless workflow integration that doesn't disrupt existing PM commands
- [ ] Configurable enhancement levels (off, basic, full)
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing PM workflows
- [ ] Error handling for enhancement failures

## Technical Details
- Extend existing PM command handlers in `src/pm/commands/`
- Create bridge layer in `src/pm/integrations/spec-intelligence.ts`
- Hook into template generation pipeline for automatic enhancement
- Add configuration options to PM settings
- Implement fallback mechanisms when spec intelligence is unavailable
- Update PM command documentation with new capabilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Dual Compiler Core (must be completed first)
- [ ] Existing PM command infrastructure
- [ ] Template system integration points

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-12
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All PM commands enhanced with spec intelligence hooks
- [ ] Integration tests covering all PM command workflows
- [ ] Configuration system updated with new options
- [ ] PM documentation updated with new features
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and meets integration standards
