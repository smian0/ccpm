# Task: Testing & Documentation

## Description
Comprehensive testing suite and documentation for the entire spec intelligence system. This includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end scenarios, and complete usage documentation covering all components from spec parsing to PM integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all core components (parsers, validators, compilers)
- [ ] Integration tests for PM system workflows
- [ ] End-to-end tests covering complete user scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for large spec files
- [ ] Error handling and edge case coverage
