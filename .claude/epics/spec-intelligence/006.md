# Task: Validation Suite

## Description
Implement comprehensive spec-specific validation rules that detect completeness gaps, ambiguity issues, and quality problems in specifications. This validation suite provides actionable feedback to improve specification quality and ensures consistency across all generated documents.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Completeness validation rules (missing sections, incomplete acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Ambiguity detection algorithms (vague language, unclear requirements)
- [ ] Consistency checking across related specifications
- [ ] Quality scoring system with actionable improvement suggestions
- [ ] Integration with MCP server validation pipeline
- [ ] Configurable validation rule sets for different specification types

## Technical Details
- Implement validation engine in `src/mcp/spec-intelligence/validator.ts`
- Create rule-based validation system with extensible validation types
- Add natural language processing for ambiguity detection
- Integrate with existing MCP server error handling
- Create validation rule configuration in `config/validation-rules.json`
- Add validation reporting and suggestion generation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: MCP Extension (provides foundation for validation integration)
- [ ] Natural language processing capabilities
- [ ] MCP server infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete validation rule engine implemented
- [ ] All validation rule types covered with tests
- [ ] Integration tests with MCP server validation pipeline
- [ ] Validation rule configuration documented
- [ ] Quality metrics and reporting system functional
- [ ] Code reviewed and meets validation standards
