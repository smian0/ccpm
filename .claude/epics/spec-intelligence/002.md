# Task: Dual Compiler Core

## Description
Build the artifact generation engine that produces both strict JSON/YAML output for machine consumption and enhanced markdown for human consumption. This core component transforms specification documents into structured data while preserving the source document's readability and adding intelligence layers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dual output compiler implemented (JSON/YAML + enhanced markdown)
- [ ] Strict schema validation for machine-readable output
- [ ] Enhanced markdown generation with semantic annotations
- [ ] Configurable output formats and schemas
- [ ] Incremental compilation support for large specifications
- [ ] Error handling with source line mapping for compilation failures

## Technical Details
- Build on MCP server extensions from Task 001
- Implement abstract syntax tree (AST) generation from spec documents
- Create dual output pipeline: structured data + annotated markdown
- Design configurable schema system for different spec types
- Implement incremental compilation for performance
- Add source mapping for error reporting and debugging
- Ensure output consistency across compilation runs

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: MCP Server Extension (provides validation infrastructure)
- [ ] Schema definition standards for spec output formats
- [ ] Performance requirements for large document processing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Dual compiler core implemented and functional
- [ ] Both output formats (structured + enhanced markdown) generated correctly
- [ ] Schema validation passing for all supported spec types
- [ ] Incremental compilation working with acceptable performance
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering edge cases
- [ ] Documentation for compiler configuration and usage
- [ ] Code reviewed and performance benchmarked
