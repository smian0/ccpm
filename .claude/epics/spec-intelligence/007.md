# Task: CLI Interface

## Description
Create a command-line wrapper for standalone use of the spec compiler, enabling direct compilation of spec files without requiring the PM system integration. This provides a lightweight interface for developers who want to use the spec intelligence features independently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CLI tool accepts spec file paths as input
- [ ] Supports both single file and directory processing
- [ ] Outputs compiled spec data in JSON format
- [ ] Includes validation and error reporting
- [ ] Provides help text and usage examples
- [ ] Supports common CLI patterns (--help, --version, --output)
- [ ] Handles file system errors gracefully

## Technical Details
- Create `bin/spec-compile` executable script
- Use the dual compiler core from task 002
- Support output redirection and file writing
- Include progress indicators for batch processing
- Implement proper exit codes for automation
- Add configuration file support for default options

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Dual Compiler Core (provides compilation functionality)
- [ ] Node.js CLI argument parsing library
- [ ] File system utilities for batch processing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] CLI help documentation complete
- [ ] Integration tests with various file types
