# Task: MCP Server Extension

## Description
Extend the existing MCP markdown server with spec-specific validators and analyzers. This foundation task provides the core infrastructure for all spec intelligence features by adding validation capabilities, semantic analysis, and structured data extraction specifically designed for specification documents.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MCP server extended with spec validation endpoints
- [ ] Semantic analysis functions for spec documents implemented
- [ ] Structured data extraction for requirements, constraints, and dependencies
- [ ] Error reporting with line-level precision for spec violations
- [ ] Integration tests with existing MCP markdown functionality
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing markdown tools maintained

## Technical Details
- Extend existing MCP markdown server located in the codebase
- Add new tool functions for spec validation and analysis
- Implement semantic parsers for common spec patterns (MUST, SHOULD, MAY keywords)
- Create structured validators for spec document hierarchy
- Add extraction capabilities for cross-references and dependencies
- Ensure minimal performance impact on existing markdown operations

## Dependencies
- [ ] No external dependencies (foundation task)
- [ ] Access to existing MCP markdown server codebase
- [ ] Understanding of MCP tool protocol

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and integrated with existing MCP server
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing for all new functions
- [ ] Integration tests with MCP protocol passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing minimal impact
- [ ] Documentation updated for new tool functions
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
