# Epic: Spec Intelligence System

## Overview
Build a "spec compiler" that validates markdown specifications for consistency while simultaneously optimizing them for LLM comprehension. The system generates dual artifacts from a single source: strict validation specs for machines and enhanced prompts for AI agents. This leverages the existing MCP markdown server (65% complete) and integrates seamlessly with PM commands.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Decisions
- **Build on MCP Markdown Server**: Extend rather than replace - the server already provides syntax validation, linting, and cross-reference checking
- **Dual Artifact Pattern**: Single source generates both strict JSON/YAML and enhanced markdown - solving the human/AI readability conflict
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with static compilation, add intelligence features incrementally
- **PM Command Integration**: Hook into existing workflow rather than creating new tools

### Technology Stack
- **Base**: MCP markdown server (existing) - provides parsing, validation, linting
- **Language**: Python for spec compiler (matches MCP server)
- **Storage**: JSON for terminology registry, YAML for validation rules
- **Integration**: Shell scripts to bridge with PM commands

### Simplification Strategy
- Leverage MCP server's existing validation capabilities (don't rebuild)
- Focus on the unique value: dual artifact generation
- Defer adaptive learning to future phase (not MVP)
- Use existing PM workflow hooks rather than new infrastructure

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

#### 1. Spec Compiler Engine
- Parse markdown specs using MCP server's existing parser
- Generate AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for analysis
- Produce dual outputs: strict + enhanced

#### 2. Validation Layer (Leverage MCP)
- Use existing: Structure validation, link checking, frontmatter validation
- Add new: Terminology consistency, completeness checking, ambiguity detection

#### 3. Enhancement Generator
- Semantic echo injection (controlled redundancy)
- Context expansion at reference points
- Automatic example generation for complex sections
- Clarification comments for ambiguous statements

#### 4. Integration Bridge
- Hook into PM commands (prd-new, epic-create, etc.)
- Pre-commit validation via git hooks
- CLI wrapper for standalone use

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: MVP (Dual Compiler)
- Static dual artifact generation
- Basic validation using MCP server
- Simple enhancement rules
- PM command integration

#### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
- Terminology registry
- Cross-spec validation
- Ambiguity scoring
- Enhanced prompts

#### Phase 3: Feedback Loop (Future)
- Implementation tracking
- Pattern learning
- Adaptive enhancement

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level tasks (keeping it simple and leveraging existing tools):

- [ ] **Task 1: MCP Server Extension** - Extend markdown server with spec-specific validators
- [ ] **Task 2: Dual Compiler Core** - Build artifact generation engine 
- [ ] **Task 3: Terminology Registry** - Create glossary system for consistent terms
- [ ] **Task 4: Enhancement Rules** - Implement semantic echo and context expansion
- [ ] **Task 5: PM Integration** - Hook compiler into existing PM commands
- [ ] **Task 6: Validation Suite** - Add spec-specific validation rules
- [ ] **Task 7: CLI Interface** - Create command-line wrapper for standalone use
- [ ] **Task 8: Testing & Documentation** - Comprehensive tests and usage docs

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **MCP Markdown Server**: Core parsing and validation engine (already installed)
- **Python 3.8+**: Runtime for compiler (matches MCP server)
- **YAML/JSON libraries**: For configuration and output

### Internal Dependencies
- **PM Command System**: Integration points for workflow
- **Git hooks**: For pre-commit validation
- **Existing PRDs/Epics**: Test data for validation

### No New Dependencies Required
- Leverages existing infrastructure
- No new services or databases
- No additional runtime requirements

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Metrics
- Validation completes in <1 second for typical specs
- Zero false positives in validation
- 50% reduction in spec-related implementation errors

### Quality Gates
- 100% of specs pass validation before commit
- No broken cross-references in production
- Terminology consistency >95%

### Integration Success
- Seamless integration with existing PM workflow
- No disruption to current development process
- Clear value demonstrated in first week

## Estimated Effort

### Timeline: 4 weeks
- **Week 1**: MCP extension and dual compiler core
- **Week 2**: Enhancement rules and terminology registry
- **Week 3**: PM integration and validation suite
- **Week 4**: Testing, documentation, and refinement

### Resource Requirements
- 1 developer familiar with Python and markdown
- Access to existing spec examples for testing
- Review from team using PM commands

### Critical Path
1. MCP server extension (enables everything else)
2. Dual compiler (core value proposition)
3. PM integration (user adoption)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **MCP Server Limitations**: Mitigate by keeping extensions minimal
- **Performance Impact**: Cache validation results, incremental processing
- **Integration Complexity**: Use simple shell bridges, minimal coupling

### Adoption Risks
- **Workflow Disruption**: Make validation optional initially
- **Learning Curve**: Provide clear examples and documentation
- **Resistance to Change**: Show immediate value with better specs

## Simplified Approach Benefits

By leveraging the existing MCP markdown server and focusing on the core innovation (dual artifacts), we can deliver value quickly with minimal complexity. The system enhances rather than replaces existing workflows, making adoption smooth and risk-free.
