# Task: Enhancement Rules Engine

## Description
Implement an intelligent enhancement system that automatically improves specification quality through semantic echo injection, context expansion, and automatic example generation. This system analyzes incomplete or ambiguous specifications and applies enhancement rules to make them more complete and actionable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Semantic echo injection system that identifies and fills specification gaps
- [ ] Context expansion engine that adds missing background information
- [ ] Automatic example generation for abstract requirements
- [ ] Rule-based enhancement pipeline with configurable rules
- [ ] Integration with existing MCP server infrastructure
- [ ] Performance metrics and enhancement quality tracking

## Technical Details
- Implement enhancement engine in `src/mcp/spec-intelligence/enhancer.ts`
- Create rule definition system with extensible rule types
- Add semantic analysis capabilities using existing LLM integration
- Integrate with MCP server's tool registration system
- Create enhancement rule configuration in `config/enhancement-rules.json`
- Add enhancement history tracking and rollback capabilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Basic MCP server functionality (already available)
- [ ] LLM integration for semantic analysis
- [ ] Configuration management system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full enhancement pipeline
- [ ] Unit tests covering all enhancement rule types
- [ ] Integration tests with MCP server
- [ ] Configuration documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Code reviewed and meets quality standards
