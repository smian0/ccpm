# Task: Terminology Registry

## Description
Create a comprehensive glossary system for maintaining consistent terminology across specifications. This independent component provides centralized term management, definition validation, and cross-reference capabilities to ensure specification consistency and reduce ambiguity.

## Acceptance Criteria
