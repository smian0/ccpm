# Task 002: Remove .stow Directory

## Overview
Delete the `.stow/` directory and all its contents as the primary step in eliminating the stowing mechanism from CCPM.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.stow/` directory completely removed from repository
- [ ] All files and subdirectories within `.stow/` deleted
- [ ] No broken symlinks remain after removal
- [ ] Git status shows clean deletion (files properly removed from tracking)
- [ ] No hidden or backup files remain

## Technical Approach
1. **Pre-removal Verification**
   - Confirm location of `.stow/` directory
   - Check for any active symlinks pointing to `.stow/` contents
   - Verify no critical processes are using files in `.stow/`

2. **Safe Removal Process**
   ```bash
   # Remove from git tracking if tracked
   git rm -rf .stow/
   
   # Remove from filesystem if untracked
   rm -rf .stow/
   ```

3. **Post-removal Validation**
   - Verify directory no longer exists: `ls -la .stow/`
   - Check for broken symlinks: `find . -type l ! -exec test -e {} \; -print`
   - Confirm git status is clean

## Safety Considerations
- This task depends on Task 001 completion to ensure no unexpected dependencies
- Simple directory deletion with minimal risk given the cleanup nature
- No data migration needed since stowing mechanism is redundant

## Expected Outcome
- `.stow/` directory completely absent from project
- No filesystem artifacts remaining
- Clean git state ready for commit

## Rollback Plan
- If issues discovered: `git checkout .stow/` to restore from last commit
- Full project backup available before epic execution

## Notes
- Straightforward deletion task with minimal complexity
- Most critical step in eliminating stowing mechanism
- Sets foundation for script cleanup in subsequent tasks
