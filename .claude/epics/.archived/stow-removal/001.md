# Task 001: Audit and Catalog Stow Components

## Overview
Systematically identify all stow-related files, directories, scripts, and configurations in the CCPM project to ensure complete removal without missing any components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Catalog all files and directories containing "stow" references
- [ ] Document stow-related scripts and configurations
- [ ] Identify any symlinks or dependencies related to stowing
- [ ] Create comprehensive inventory for safe removal
- [ ] Verify no critical functionality depends on stowing mechanism

## Technical Approach
1. **File System Scan**: Search entire project for stow-related files
   ```bash
   find . -name "*stow*" -type f
   find . -name "*stow*" -type d
   ```

2. **Content Search**: Find files containing stow references
   ```bash
   grep -r "stow" . --exclude-dir=.git
   ```

3. **Script Analysis**: Examine installation and setup scripts
   - Check `install-*.sh` scripts
   - Review any package management scripts
   - Look for stow-related configurations

4. **Documentation Review**: Search docs for stow mentions
   - README files
   - Installation guides
   - Configuration documentation

## Expected Findings
- `.stow/` directory and contents
- References in installation scripts
- Documentation mentioning stowing setup
- Any configuration files with stow parameters

## Output
- Complete inventory of all stow-related components
- Assessment of removal safety for each component
- Documentation of any unexpected dependencies discovered

## Notes
- This is pure reconnaissance - no files will be modified
- Focus on comprehensive discovery to prevent incomplete removal
- Pay special attention to hidden files and symlinks
