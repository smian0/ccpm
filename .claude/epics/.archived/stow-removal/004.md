# Task 004: Verification and Testing

## Overview
Comprehensively test CCPM functionality after stow removal to ensure no regressions and validate that all core PM commands work normally without the stowing mechanism.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All PM commands function without errors
- [ ] Installation process works without stow-related steps
- [ ] No broken references or orphaned files remain
- [ ] Git status shows clean state
- [ ] Core CCPM workflows operate normally
- [ ] No stow-related error messages appear

## Technical Approach
1. **Core PM Command Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test essential PM commands
   /pm:status
   /pm:init (in test directory)
   /pm:prd-new test-feature
   /pm:epic-decompose test-feature
   /pm:issue-start
   /pm:next
   ```

2. **Installation Verification**
   - Test installation process in clean environment
   - Verify no stow-related dependencies required
   - Confirm setup completes without stowing steps
   - Validate all necessary components are properly installed

3. **System Integrity Checks**
   ```bash
   # Check for broken references
   find . -type l ! -exec test -e {} \; -print
   
   # Verify no stow references remain
   grep -r "stow" . --exclude-dir=.git
   
   # Check git status
   git status
   ```

4. **Functional Workflow Testing**
   - Complete PRD → Epic → Task workflow
   - Test context loading and memory operations
   - Verify OpenCode integration works without stowing
   - Validate all agent operations function normally

## Expected Results
- Clean execution of all tested commands
- No error messages related to missing stow components
- Successful installation without stow dependencies
- Normal operation of all CCPM workflows
- Clean git state with no orphaned references

## Regression Testing
- Compare functionality before and after stow removal
- Ensure no loss of core capabilities
- Verify performance remains unaffected
- Confirm all existing features work as expected

## Rollback Criteria
If critical issues discovered:
- Restore `.stow/` directory from git
- Revert script changes
- Document issues for future resolution
- Epic marked as blocked pending investigation

## Success Metrics
- Zero stow-related errors in testing
- 100% of core PM commands operational
- Clean installation process validation
- Complete elimination of stowing mechanism
- Simplified project structure confirmed

## Notes
- Final validation step before epic completion
- Most comprehensive testing phase
- Leverages existing test infrastructure per CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Ensures atomic change doesn't break functionality
