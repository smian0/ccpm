# Task 003: Clean Scripts and Documentation

## Overview
Remove all stow references from installation scripts, setup scripts, and documentation to complete the elimination of stowing mechanism from CCPM.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero references to "stow" in installation scripts
- [ ] No stow-related commands in setup scripts
- [ ] Documentation updated to remove stow mentions
- [ ] Configuration files cleaned of stow parameters
- [ ] No stow-related functions or utilities remain
- [ ] Script functionality preserved without stowing components

## Technical Approach
1. **Script Cleanup**
   - Review `install-*.sh` scripts for stow commands
   - Remove stow-related setup steps from installation process
   - Clean any package management scripts
   - Update script comments and documentation

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Search and remove stow references from README files
   - Update installation instructions
   - Clean configuration documentation
   - Remove stow-related troubleshooting sections

3. **Configuration Cleanup**
   - Remove stow parameters from config files
   - Clean environment variable references
   - Update any template files that mention stowing

4. **Code Review**
   ```bash
   # Find and review all remaining references
   grep -r "stow" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.stow
   ```

## Expected Changes
Based on audit from Task 001, likely modifications to:
- Installation scripts removing stow setup commands
- README/documentation removing stow installation steps
- Configuration files removing stow-related parameters
- Any utility scripts that referenced stowing mechanism

## Validation
- Manual review of all modified files
- Test installation process without stow steps
- Verify documentation accuracy after updates
- Confirm no broken references remain

## Safety Considerations
- Preserve core functionality while removing stow references
- Maintain installation process integrity
- Ensure documentation remains accurate and complete
- Test changes don't break existing workflows

## Notes
- Most complex task due to potential scattered references
- Requires careful review to avoid breaking installation process
- Documentation updates must maintain clarity for users
- May discover additional stow dependencies during cleanup
