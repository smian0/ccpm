# Project Progress

## Current Status
**Phase**: Active Development - Integration Enhancement  
**Branch**: develop (4 commits ahead of origin/develop)  
**Last Activity**: September 16, 2025

## Recent Completed Work

### Serena Integration (Latest)
- âœ… Enhanced CLAUDE.md with Serena integration and new command structure
- âœ… Implemented transparent memory management for PM commands
- âœ… Created automatic context-to-memory synchronization
- âœ… Added comprehensive memory naming patterns for project knowledge

### OpenCode Integration
- âœ… Added agent and command transformation plugins for OpenCode integration
- âœ… Updated context documentation with MCP server integration details
- âœ… Established bridge between Claude and OpenCode systems

### Installation & Setup Improvements  
- âœ… Enhanced install-ccpm.sh with backup functionality and dynamic source path
- âœ… Refactored agent installation process for better reliability
- âœ… Added new CLAUDE.md files and updated .gitignore
- âœ… Created comprehensive context and project documentation files

### Infrastructure Enhancements
- âœ… Added installation and override scripts for enhanced project setup
- âœ… Updated Zhipuai API configuration and model updates in opencode.json
- âœ… Refactored installation scripts and enhanced project setup

## Current Work in Progress

### Context System Enhancement
- ðŸ”„ Creating comprehensive project context documentation
- ðŸ”„ Establishing baseline context files for new installations
- ðŸ”„ Testing context creation and validation workflows

### Integration Testing
- ðŸ”„ Validating Serena memory integration with PM commands
- ðŸ”„ Testing OpenCode transformation plugins
- ðŸ”„ Verifying installation script reliability

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Complete Context System**
   - Finish context file creation and validation
   - Test context priming and update workflows
   - Validate context-to-Serena memory sync

2. **Integration Validation**
   - Test end-to-end workflow with Serena integration
   - Validate OpenCode plugin functionality
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README with new integration capabilities
   - Create migration guide for existing users
   - Document new memory management features

## Outstanding Issues

### Technical Debt
- Multiple versions of similar commands between .claude and .opencode
- Need to consolidate command structures post-integration
- Installation script complexity could be simplified

### Testing Gaps
- Limited automated testing for complex integration workflows
- Manual testing required for MCP server integrations
- Need comprehensive end-to-end test suite

## Metrics & Health

### Repository State
- **Commits Ahead**: 4 commits ahead of origin/develop
- **Modified Files**: ~70 files with pending changes (mostly integration work)
- **Untracked Files**: Several new integration components

### Command System
- **PM Commands**: 30+ commands available
- **Agent Types**: 4+ specialized agents
- **Integration Points**: 2 active MCP servers (Serena, OpenCode)

### Documentation Coverage
- **Core Workflows**: Well documented
- **Integration Features**: Recently updated
- **Context System**: Being established now

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Core PM workflow functionality is stable
- Installation processes are well-tested
- Git worktree operations are mature

### Medium Risk  
- New MCP integrations need validation
- Context system is being established
- Multiple command versions could cause confusion

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing before major releases
- Clear migration documentation
- Gradual rollout of new integration features
