# Project Brief

## What is CCPM?
Claude Code PM is a comprehensive workflow system that transforms how development teams work with Claude Code by providing structured, spec-driven development processes with full traceability and parallel execution capabilities.

## Why Does CCPM Exist?
Every development team faces recurring challenges:
- **Context Loss**: Information evaporates between sessions, forcing constant re-discovery
- **Parallel Work Conflicts**: Multiple developers touching the same code creates merge conflicts
- **Requirements Drift**: Verbal decisions override written specifications
- **Invisible Progress**: Development progress only becomes visible at the very end

CCPM eliminates these problems through systematic workflows and tooling.

## Core Value Proposition
**"Stop losing context. Stop blocking on tasks. Stop shipping bugs."**

CCPM provides a battle-tested system that turns:
- PRDs into structured epics
- Epics into actionable GitHub issues
- Issues into production code
- All with complete traceability at every step

## Success Criteria
1. **Zero Context Loss**: All decisions, requirements, and progress are captured and accessible
2. **Conflict-Free Parallel Work**: Multiple streams of work proceed simultaneously without interference
3. **Requirements Traceability**: Clear path from business requirements to implemented code
4. **Faster Time to Market**: Reduced rework and improved coordination lead to faster delivery
5. **Higher Code Quality**: Systematic approach reduces bugs and technical debt

## Target Users
- **Development Teams** using Claude Code for software development
- **Technical Product Managers** managing feature development workflows
- **Engineering Leaders** seeking to improve team productivity and code quality
- **Solo Developers** wanting structured approaches to complex projects

## Key Differentiators
- **Spec-Driven Approach**: No "vibe coding" - everything starts with clear specifications
- **Parallel Agent Architecture**: Multiple AI agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Git Worktree Integration**: True isolation for parallel development streams
- **Complete Automation**: From PRD creation to GitHub issue synchronization
- **Battle-Tested**: Proven in real-world development scenarios

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- Workflow automation for Claude Code development
- GitHub Issues integration and management
- Git worktree orchestration
- Parallel agent execution framework
- Project context and state management
- MCP server integrations (Serena, OpenCode)

**Out of Scope:**
- General project management beyond development workflows
- Non-Claude Code development environments
- Direct code generation (delegates to Claude Code)
- Repository hosting or Git server functionality
