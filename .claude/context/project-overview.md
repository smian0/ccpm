# Project Overview

## Project Identity
**Claude Code PM (CCPM)** is a comprehensive workflow system designed for Claude Code that enables spec-driven development through GitHub issues integration, Git worktrees, and parallel AI agent execution.

## Current State
- **Branch**: develop (4 commits ahead of origin/develop)
- **Status**: Active development with recent Serena integration work
- **Primary Focus**: Enhancing integration capabilities with MCP servers

## Core Features
- **Spec-Driven Development**: PRD → Epic → GitHub Issues → Production Code
- **Parallel Agent Execution**: Multiple AI agents working simultaneously without conflicts
- **Git Worktree Integration**: Isolated development environments for parallel work
- **GitHub Issues Integration**: Complete traceability from requirements to implementation
- **Context Management**: Comprehensive project documentation and state tracking

## Recent Development Activity
Based on recent commits:
1. Enhanced CLAUDE.md with Serena integration and new command structure
2. Added agent and command transformation plugins for OpenCode integration
3. Updated context documentation with MCP server integration details
4. Enhanced installation scripts with backup functionality
5. Refactored agent installation processes

## Key Components
- **Command System**: 30+ PM commands for managing workflow
- **Agent System**: Specialized agents for different development tasks
- **Context System**: Project documentation and state management
- **Integration Layer**: OpenCode and Serena MCP server integrations

## Project Goals
- Eliminate context loss between development sessions
- Enable conflict-free parallel development
- Maintain requirements traceability throughout development lifecycle
- Provide battle-tested workflows for shipping quality code faster

## Current Capabilities
- Complete PRD-to-production workflow
- Automated epic decomposition into actionable tasks
- Parallel work stream analysis and execution
- Git worktree management for isolated development
- Comprehensive project state tracking and reporting
