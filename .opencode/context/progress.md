- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and migration guides
- ✅ Agent system for parallel execution
- ✅ GitHub integration with issue management
- ✅ Context preservation system

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Context System Setup**: Complete initial context creation (in progress)
2. **Testing Framework**: Validate all PM commands work correctly
3. **Documentation**: Ensure all command references are up-to-date
4. **Integration Testing**: Test GitHub sync functionality
5. **Agent Validation**: Verify parallel execution system

## Current Development Focus
- OpenCode integration and compatibility
- Enhanced documentation and migration guides
- System stability and error handling
- User experience improvements

## Known Issues
