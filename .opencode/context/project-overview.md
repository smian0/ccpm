# Project Overview

## High-Level Summary

Claude Code PM (CCPM) is a battle-tested project management system that transforms the chaos of AI-assisted development into a structured, traceable workflow. It bridges the gap between product vision and shipped code through a disciplined process that eliminates context loss, enables parallel execution, and maintains full accountability.

## Core Capabilities

### ðŸ§  Context Preservation System
- **Persistent State**: Project context survives across AI sessions
- **Agent Coordination**: Multiple AI agents share coherent understanding
- **Session Continuity**: Pick up exactly where you left off
- **Knowledge Retention**: No repeated explanations or rediscovery

### âš¡ Parallel Execution Engine
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: 3-8 agents working simultaneously per epic
- **Conflict-Free Development**: Git worktrees provide isolation
- **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Agents specialize by work type
- **Consolidated Results**: Clean integration of parallel work streams

### ðŸ“‹ Spec-Driven Development Workflow
- **PRD Creation**: Comprehensive product requirement documentation
- **Epic Planning**: Technical implementation with architectural decisions
- **Task Decomposition**: Concrete, actionable development tasks
- **Full Traceability**: Every line of code traces back to requirements

### ðŸ”— Native GitHub Integration
- **Issues as Database**: GitHub issues provide single source of truth
- **Team Collaboration**: Human and AI progress visible to all
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Epics track sub-task completion
- **Progress Transparency**: Real-time updates without meetings

## Key Features

### Product Management Layer
- **PRD Management**: Create, edit, and lifecycle management of requirements
- **Epic Planning**: Transform PRDs into technical implementation plans
- **Task Breakdown**: Decompose epics into parallel-executable tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status across all work streams

### Development Orchestration
- **Agent Specialization**: Right tool for every job (UI, API, database, testing)
- **Parallel Coordination**: Multiple agents per issue without conflicts
- **Context Isolation**: Agents work independently while maintaining coherence
- **Result Consolidation**: Clean integration of distributed work

### GitHub Workflow Integration
- **Issue Creation**: Automatic issue generation from local planning
- **Progress Synchronization**: Bidirectional sync between local and GitHub
- **Team Visibility**: Comments and updates for human team members
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history from idea to production

### Command Interface
- **Slash Commands**: Simple, memorable interface for all operations
- **Workflow Automation**: Multi-step processes executed with single commands
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Smart behavior based on project context
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures and edge cases

## System Architecture

### Local Workspace
```
.claude/epics/feature-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ epic.md              # Implementation plan
â”œâ”€â”€ 001.md               # Task files (become issue IDs)
â”œâ”€â”€ 002.md               # Parallel development tasks
â””â”€â”€ updates/             # Work-in-progress tracking
```

### GitHub Integration
```
GitHub Issues
â”œâ”€â”€ Epic Issue (#1234)   # Parent epic with task list
â”œâ”€â”€ Task Issue (#1235)   # Individual development tasks
â””â”€â”€ Sub-Issues           # Detailed implementation work
```

### Agent Coordination
```
Issue #1235 â†’ Multiple Agents
â”œâ”€â”€ Agent 1: Database work (worktree-1)
â”œâ”€â”€ Agent 2: API endpoints (worktree-2)
â”œâ”€â”€ Agent 3: UI components (worktree-3)
â””â”€â”€ Agent 4: Tests/docs  (worktree-4)
```

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Product Planning
**Command**: `/pm:prd-new feature-name`
- Guided brainstorming for comprehensive requirements
- User stories, success criteria, and constraints
- Market analysis and competitive positioning
- **Output**: `.claude/prds/feature-name.md`

### 2. Implementation Planning
**Command**: `/pm:prd-parse feature-name`
- Technical architecture and design decisions
- Dependency mapping and risk assessment
- Resource estimation and timeline planning
- **Output**: `.claude/epics/feature-name/epic.md`

### 3. Task Decomposition
**Command**: `/pm:epic-decompose feature-name`
- Break epic into concrete, actionable tasks
- Parallelization analysis and conflict detection
- Acceptance criteria and effort estimation
- **Output**: Individual task files with parallel execution flags

### 4. GitHub Synchronization
**Command**: `/pm:epic-sync feature-name`
- Create GitHub issues from local planning
- Establish parent-child relationships
- Apply appropriate labels and organization
- **Output**: Live GitHub issues ready for development

### 5. Parallel Execution
**Command**: `/pm:issue-start 1234`
- Analyze task for parallelization opportunities
- Spawn specialized agents for different work streams
- Coordinate through Git worktrees and context files
- **Output**: Concurrent development across multiple agents
