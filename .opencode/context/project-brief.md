# Project Brief

## Project Overview

**Claude Code PM (CCPM)** is a comprehensive project management system designed specifically for AI-assisted software development. The system transforms product requirements into shipped code through structured workflows, GitHub integration, and parallel AI agent execution.

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate Context Loss**: Maintain project state across AI sessions through persistent context files
2. **Enable Parallel Execution**: Multiple AI agents working simultaneously on different aspects of the same feature
3. **Enforce Spec-Driven Development**: No "vibe coding" - every line traces back to documented specifications
4. **Provide Full Traceability**: Complete audit trail from PRD â†’ Epic â†’ Task â†’ Issue â†’ Code â†’ Commit
5. **Integrate with Existing Tools**: Native GitHub integration without requiring new infrastructure

### Secondary Goals
1. **Support Multiple AI Platforms**: Claude Code and OpenCode compatibility
2. **Scale Team Collaboration**: Enable human-AI team coordination
3. **Reduce Bug Rates**: Structured planning and task decomposition
4. **Accelerate Delivery**: Parallel execution and intelligent prioritization

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Product Requirements Management**: PRD creation, editing, and lifecycle management
- **Epic Planning**: Technical implementation planning and architectural decisions
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking epics into concrete, actionable tasks
- **GitHub Integration**: Issue creation, synchronization, and progress tracking
- **Agent System**: Specialized agents for different types of development work
- **Context Preservation**: Persistent project state across sessions
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-agent coordination and conflict-free development
- **Command Interface**: Slash commands for all PM operations
- **Worktree Management**: Git isolation for parallel development streams

### Out of Scope
- **GitHub Projects API**: Intentionally avoided for simplicity
- **Custom Database**: Uses GitHub as the single source of truth
- **Real-time Collaboration UI**: Focused on command-line workflow
- **Project Management UI**: GitHub issues provide the interface
- **Non-Git Workflows**: Requires Git for version control and worktrees

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Context Preservation**: 100% context retention across sessions
- **Parallel Execution**: 3-8 simultaneous work streams per epic
- **Development Velocity**: 3x faster feature delivery compared to serial development
- **Bug Reduction**: 75% reduction in bug rates through structured planning
- **Context Switching**: 89% reduction in time lost to context switching

### Qualitative Indicators
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless workflow from idea to production
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear visibility into AI and human work streams
- **Documentation Quality**: Complete traceability and audit trails
- **System Reliability**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation
- **Platform Independence**: Consistent experience across Claude Code and OpenCode

## Key Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Git Dependency**: Requires Git for version control and worktree support
- **GitHub Integration**: Designed for GitHub-hosted repositories
- **Shell Environment**: Bash scripting for cross-platform compatibility
- **AI Platform Support**: Limited to Claude Code and OpenCode initially

### Business Constraints
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed for broad adoption
- **No External Services**: Self-contained system using existing tools
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential tools (Git, GitHub CLI, Python for MCP)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support migration between AI platforms

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **AI-Assisted Developers**: Individual developers working with AI agents
- **Development Teams**: Teams collaborating with AI agents
- **Project Managers**: Tracking progress and coordinating work
- **Technical Leads**: Maintaining architecture and code quality

### Secondary Users
- **Open Source Contributors**: Community members extending the system
- **AI Platform Providers**: Claude Code and OpenCode teams
- **Tool Integrators**: Developers building complementary tools

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **GitHub API Changes**: Dependency on stable GitHub Issues API
- **AI Platform Evolution**: Changes to Claude Code or OpenCode tooling
- **Git Worktree Limitations**: Edge cases in parallel development scenarios

### Medium Risk
- **Performance at Scale**: Large numbers of parallel agents and issues
- **Configuration Complexity**: Setup requirements across different environments
- **Migration Challenges**: Moving between AI platforms or project structures

### Low Risk
- **Documentation Currency**: Keeping docs aligned with rapid development
- **Community Adoption**: Building user base and contributor community
- **Feature Creep**: Maintaining focus on core PM functionality
