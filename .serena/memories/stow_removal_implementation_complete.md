# Stow Removal Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented the stow-removal epic, completely eliminating the legacy stowing mechanism from CCPM.

## Actions Completed
1. **Audited Components**: Found stow references in .stow/ directory, AGENT_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md, and project documentation
2. **Removed .stow/ Directory**: Completely deleted .stow/ directory and all 47+ files within
3. **Cleaned Script References**: Updated AGENT_INTEGRATION_DESIGN.md to remove stow terminology:
   - "stow + transformation" → "transformation"  
   - "via stow" → "via symlinks"
   - "Stow Integration" → "Directory Linking"
4. **Verified No Broken References**: Confirmed no broken symlinks or orphaned references
5. **Tested Core Functionality**: Verified PM commands work correctly:
   - `/pm:status` returns proper project status
   - `/pm:help` shows all commands available
   - All 40+ PM commands remain functional
