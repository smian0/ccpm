# Epic: Stow Removal - Task Breakdown

## Task Structure Created

### 001: Audit and Catalog Stow Components
- **Purpose**: Systematic discovery of all stow-related files and references
- **Complexity**: 2 (0.5 hours)
- **Approach**: File system scan, content search, script analysis, documentation review
- **Output**: Complete inventory for safe removal

### 002: Remove .stow Directory  
- **Purpose**: Delete primary stowing mechanism directory
- **Complexity**: 1 (0.25 hours) 
- **Dependencies**: Task 001
- **Approach**: Git removal, filesystem deletion, validation
- **Risk**: Minimal - straightforward deletion

### 003: Clean Scripts and Documentation
- **Purpose**: Remove stow references from installation/setup scripts and docs
- **Complexity**: 3 (0.75 hours)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 001, 002
- **Approach**: Script cleanup, documentation updates, configuration cleanup
- **Risk**: Medium - requires careful preservation of core functionality

### 004: Verification and Testing
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing to ensure no regressions
- **Complexity**: 2 (0.5 hours)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 001, 002, 003
- **Approach**: PM command testing, installation verification, system integrity checks
- **Validation**: All core CCPM workflows must operate normally

## Epic Summary
- **Total Estimated Effort**: 2 hours
- **Task Dependencies**: Linear sequence (001 → 002 → 003 → 004)
- **Risk Level**: Low - pure cleanup with comprehensive validation
- **Success Criteria**: Complete elimination of stowing mechanism without functional regression

## Implementation Strategy
- Atomic change approach: all tasks completed in single focused session
- Safety-first: extensive validation at each step
- Zero tolerance for breaking core PM functionality
- Leverages existing test infrastructure per project guidelines

## Context
Created during Serena integration testing session. Part of broader OpenCode globalization effort where local stowing mechanisms become redundant. Epic supports project simplification and technical debt reduction goals.
